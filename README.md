# Arduino temperature, humidity, air quality
In this project I created a project at arduino with Temperature Sensor and MQ-7 Carbon Monoxide Sensor.

## How I start
Firstly I created the circut in the breadboard to be sure that everything works fine. In the picture below you can see that it displays temperature, humidity and air quality. For air-quality when it hits values lower than 60 say that air quality is good and for higher indicates danger.
