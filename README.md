# Arduino temperature, humidity, air quality
In this project I created a project at arduino with Temperature Sensor and MQ-7 Carbon Monoxide Sensor.

## First Part
Firstly I created the circut in the breadboard to be sure that everything works fine. In the picture below you can see that it displays temperature, humidity and air quality. For air-quality when it hits values lower than 60 say that air quality is good and for higher indicates danger.
In the image and video below you can see the results.

## Second Part
After this trial I decided to make a product that is more capable and easy to transfer. So I got an old box and I measured the dimensions, I soldered the cables and I add them to the box. 
The result is below:
